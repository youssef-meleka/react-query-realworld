# Revision History UI: Add a new section on the article detail page to display the revision history.

- List all previous revisions with details (e.g., timestamps).

- Provide a UI control (e.g., a "Revert" button) next to each revision (visible only to authorized users).

- API Integration: Connect the UI components to the backend API endpoints to fetch revision data and trigger reverts.

- User Experience: Provide clear feedback (e.g., success/error notifications) for user actions.
